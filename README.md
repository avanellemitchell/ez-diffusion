This project tests how well the EZ diffusion model can recover parameters when applied to data generated using the same model. The goal is to determine if the estimation process produces reliable results under different sample sizes. The EZ diffusion model is a simplified version of the drift diffusion model that allows estimation of three key parameters- drift rate, boundary separation, and non decision time. It does this using only summary statistics from response times and accuracy, making it much faster than traditional fitting methods that require complex numerical calculations.
To evaluate the model, a simulate and recover approach was used. First, true parameters were generated by randomly selecting values within realistic ranges. Boundary separation was set between 0.5 and 2, drift rate between 0.5 and 2, and non decision time between 0.1 and 0.5. Next, response times and accuracy were simulated for a given sample size using the forward EZ equations. From this simulated data, summary statistics such as mean response time, variance of response time, and accuracy were computed. These values were then used to recover estimated parameters by applying the inverse EZ equations. To measure accuracy, bias and squared error were calculated. Bias represents the difference between the true and estimated parameters, while squared error measures how far off the estimates are on average. This process was repeated 1,000 times for each sample size, using N values of 10, 40, and 4000.
The results showed that the EZ diffusion model performs well under these conditions. Bias remained close to zero on average, meaning the recovered parameters were not consistently too high or too low. Squared error decreased as N increased, which means that larger sample sizes led to more precise estimates. When using small sample sizes such as N equals 10, there was more variability in the recovered parameters, sometimes resulting in extreme estimates. In contrast, when N was 4000, the estimates closely matched the true values, demonstrating that the model works better with more data.
This experiment confirms that the EZ diffusion model can successfully estimate parameters from data generated using the same model. The results follow the expected pattern, where increasing N reduces error while bias remains low. This suggests that the model is internally consistent and can be useful for analyzing response time data in situations where a full drift diffusion model fit is not necessary. It also highlights the importance of having a sufficient number of trials. When sample sizes are too small, the recovered parameters become unreliable.
This project follows best practices in cognitive modeling, including structured code, unit testing, and automated scripts. The simulate and recover method is an important way to confirm that a model behaves as expected. While real world data introduces additional challenges, this study shows that under ideal conditions, the EZ diffusion model provides reasonable parameter estimates and can be a valuable tool for cognitive research.
